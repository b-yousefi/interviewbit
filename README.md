This repository is a collection of my solutions to programming problems at [interviwebit](https://www.interviewbit.com/profile/b_yousefi). I included one or two tests for each solution just to show how each class is supposed to work. I wish I had more spare time to complete the test cases and cover more scenarios. 

I categorized the solutions in separate packages the same way as the website:
- array
- math
- binarySearch
- string
- bitManipulation
- twoPointers
- linkedLists
- stack
- hashing
